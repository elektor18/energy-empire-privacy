    <h1>Privacy Policy for <strong>Energy Empire</strong></h1>
    <div class="meta">Last updated: December 2025</div>

    <p>Thank you for playing <strong>Energy Empire</strong>. This privacy policy explains how the game handles data on your device.</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>Energy Empire</strong> is a mobile strategy game that runs primarily on your device. The game does <strong>not</strong> collect personal information or transmit gameplay data to external servers operated by the developer.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Energy Empire</strong> itself does <em>not</em> collect or store any personally identifiable information.</p>
    <p>However, the game uses the <strong>Google Mobile Ads SDK</strong>, which may collect the following data for ad delivery and personalization:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device identifiers (for ad frequency capping and attribution)</li>
      <li>Approximate location (for ad relevance)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These data are collected and processed by Google according to their own privacy policies. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>The game stores only the following information locally on your device (via Android's app storage):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Game progress (tile states, upgrades, production)</li>
      <li>Player statistics</li>
      <li>Settings</li>
      <li>Daily rewards and streak timestamps</li>
      <li>Ad watches and rewarded-ad counters</li>
      <li>Pending operations (build, claim, upgrade)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device and is accessible only to the game app (sandboxed by the OS).</p>

    <h2>4. Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p><strong>Google Mobile Ads SDK</strong> is used to display banner, interstitial and rewarded ads. Google may collect certain device information according to their privacy practices. You can manage ad personalization in your Google account settings.</p>
    <p>We do not use analytics services, crash reporting, or other third‑party trackers by default. If additional services are integrated in the future, this policy will be updated accordingly.</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p><strong>Energy Empire</strong> is suitable for all ages (recommended PEGI/ESRB: Everyone). The game does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>Because we do not collect personal data, there is no personal data stored on our servers. Local save data is stored in the Android app sandbox. Communication with ad servers is encrypted by the ad provider.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the updated policy on the official project page and update the <code>Last updated</code> date at the top of this page.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact the developer at:</p>

    <div class="footer">
      <p>Energy Empire does not collect personal information directly. Third-party ad behavior is governed by their respective privacy policies. This policy is provided for transparency and to help you understand what data is used for ad delivery.</p>
